## üê≥ Docker (Quick Testing)

Build and run with Docker:
```bash
docker build -t metadetect .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=<your-db-url> -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=<user> -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=<pass> -e SUPABASE_URL=<url> -e SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<key> -e SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=<secret> metadetect
```

## Building and Running a Local Instance
In order to build and use this project you must install the following:

1. Maven 3.9.11: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi Download and follow the installation instructions, be sure to set the bin as described in Maven's README as a new path variable by editing the system variables if you are on windows or by following the instructions for MacOS.
2. JDK 18: This project used JDK 18 for development so that is what I recommend you use: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html
3. IntelliJ IDE: I recommend using IntelliJ but you are free to use any other IDE that you are comfortable with: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows
4. When you open IntelliJ you have the option to clone from a GitHub repo, click the green code button and copy the http line that is provided there and give it to your IDE to clone.
5. That should be it in order to build the project with maven you can run <code>mvn -B package --file pom.xml</code> and then you can either run the tests via the test files described below or the main application by running AdvanceJavaStudentEngineers.java from your IDE.
6. If you wish to run the style checker you can with <code>mvn checkstyle:check</code> or <code>mvn checkstyle:checkstyle</code> if you wish to generate the report.
7. For static bug checking using **PMD**, see the official site: https://pmd.github.io


My endpoints are listed below in the "Endpoints" section, with brief descriptions of their parameters. 

## Running Tests
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My unit tests are located under the directory 'src/test'. To run my project's tests in IntelliJ using Java 18, you must first build the project.

From there, you can right-click any of the classes present in the src/test directory and click run to see the results.

From the terminal, run the following CLI commands:
```bash
    ## Run Unit Tests
    mvn clean test

    ## Run Jacoco, can only be done after unit tests run
    mvn jacoco:report

    ## Run PMD static debugger
    mvn pmd:pmd

    ## Run Checkstyle
    mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
    ## OR
    mvn checkstyle:check
```
## How to Run
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Create environment file:**  
   In your project directory, create a file named `env.pooler.sh` (see email for keys).

2. **Set environment variables in terminal:**
   ```bash
   set -a
   source env.pooler.sh
   set +a
   ```

3. **Compile Maven project:**
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```

4. **Run Spring Boot application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Running the Application with Docker
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### üê≥ What is Docker?
Docker packages your application and its dependencies into a container so that it runs identically across any environment. It‚Äôs a portable and lightweight runtime environment ‚Äî ideal for ensuring consistent deployments.

### üì¶ What the Dockerfile Does
The `Dockerfile` builds the MetaDetect image in two stages:
1. **Build Stage:**  
   - Uses a Maven + Java 17 base image.  
   - Copies the source files and builds the JAR via `mvn clean package -DskipTests`.  
2. **Runtime Stage:**  
   - Uses a lightweight Java 17 runtime.  
   - Copies the built JAR and required C2PA binaries.  
   - Exposes port `8080` and runs the application.

This keeps the final image small and production-ready.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before running the application with Docker:
1. **Install Docker Desktop:** [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. **Create a `.env` file** at the root of the project containing environment variables:
   ```env
   SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://your-database-host:5432/postgres
   SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=your-username
   SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your-password
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** include quotation marks around any values.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** commit your `.env` file to Git.

### üöÄ How to Build and Run

**Step 1: Build the Docker Image**
```bash
docker build -t metadetect .
```

**Step 2: Run the Container**
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env metadetect
```

**Step 3: Access the API**
- API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)  **Not yet implemented**
- API Docs: [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)  **Not yet implemented**

### üß∞ Useful Docker Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|----------|
| Run in background | `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env --name metadetect-app metadetect` |
| View logs | `docker logs -f metadetect-app` |
| Stop container | `docker stop metadetect-app` |
| Start container | `docker start metadetect-app` |
| Remove container | `docker rm metadetect-app` |
| List running containers | `docker ps` |
| Rebuild after code changes | `docker build -t metadetect .` |

---

### üß© Troubleshooting

- **Port 8080 already in use** ‚Üí Use another port:  
  `docker run -p 8081:8080 --env-file .env metadetect`
- **Cannot connect to Docker daemon** ‚Üí Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
- **Connection refused / Database errors** ‚Üí Check `.env` file values and ensure DB is accessible.
- **401 Unauthorized** ‚Üí Normal. The API requires a JWT token for protected routes.

---

### üß± Development vs. Production
- For **local development**, you can still run the app with:
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- For **production**, Docker ensures consistent runtime behavior across environments.

---

### üìä Image Size Overview
Final image size: ~400‚Äì500 MB  
Includes:
- Java 17 JRE  
- Compiled JAR  
- C2PA binaries  
- Minimal Linux libraries  

---

### ‚úÖ Summary
To containerize and run MetaDetect:
```bash
docker build -t metadetect .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env metadetect
```

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî your application is now running inside Docker! üêã

## Branch Coverage Reporting
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I used JaCoCo to perform branch analysis in order to see the branch coverage of the relevant code within the code base. See below
for screenshots demonstrating output.

## Tools used 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This section includes notes on tools and technologies used in building this project, as well as any additional details if applicable.

* Maven Package Manager
* GitHub Actions CI
  * This is enabled via the "Actions" tab on GitHub.
  * Currently, this just runs a Maven build to make sure the code builds on branch 'main'.
* Checkstyle
  * We use Checkstyle for code reporting. Note that Checkstyle does NOT get run as part of the CI pipeline.
  * For running Checkstyle manually, you can use the "Checkstyle-IDEA" plugin for IntelliJ.
* PMD
  * We are using PMD to do static analysis of our Java code.
  * Originally we were planning on using SonarQube, however we did not do this as it requires us to either pay or setup a server to host a SonarQube instance.
* JUnit
  * JUnit tests get run automatically as part of the CI pipeline.
* JaCoCo
  * We use JaCoCo for generating code coverage reports.
  * Originally we were planning on using Cobertura, however Cobertura does not support our version of Java.
* c2patool
  * We use the open-source c2patool to scrape manifest metadata for determining the usage of AI in generating an image.
  * Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). *c2patool (Version 0.23.4)*.  
  * Content Authenticity Initiative, Adobe Systems, 2024.
