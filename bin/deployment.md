Platform as a Service helps users easily deploy their applications to the cloud and manage them.

It simplifies and unifies the process of deploying to the cloud through multiple services.

The services can be development environments, scalability, auto updates of software/infrastructure, database management, and multi-tenacity.

Benefits include cost savings, deployment efficiency and much more.

Some PaaS I've used before are Vercel and Heroku.
