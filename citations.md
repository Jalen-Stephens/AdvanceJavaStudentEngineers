### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

The AI assistant was used to help set up the initial iteration of the MetaDetect AI Image Detection Service project by providing technical guidance on:

* Refactoring and renaming the base Spring Boot application from **IndividualProject** → **MetaDetect**
* Updating Java package paths to `dev.coms4156.project.metadetect`
* Revising the `pom.xml` to reflect new coordinates (`groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, `name`) and to add Checkstyle, PMD, and JaCoCo (≥ 55 % coverage)
* Adjusting `application.properties` to use `spring.application.name=metadetect-service` and `spring.application.version=0.1.0`
* Cleaning Git tracking (`.gitignore` fixes and `.idea` untracking)
* Crafting consistent commit messages and PR templates mapped to the Kanban workflow

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

Prompts and questions provided to ChatGPT included:

* “What should my Kanban ticket be called for setting up the skeleton code?”
* “How should I rename my Spring Boot app and packages to MetaDetect?”
* “Update my `pom.xml` to include PMD and JaCoCo 55 % coverage.”
* “How do I remove tracked `.idea` files if they’re already in `.gitignore`?”
* “Give me a proper commit message for the init branch (#2).”

---

* **Tool Used:** OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5)
* **Access Method:** ChatGPT Web (.edu academic access)
* **Configuration:** Default model settings
* **Cost:** $0 (no paid API calls)

---

### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

The AI assisted in designing and drafting controller-slice tests for the `/auth/*` endpoints, as well as creating a dedicated Spring Security test configuration to allow unauthenticated access for the proxy tests. It also helped refine the JSON content-type enforcement in the proxy response so the controller tests aligned with expected client behavior.

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

* Requested a controller-level test suite for `AuthController`.
* Noticed 403 and 401 blocking proxy tests → requested correction for security config.
* Asked for `SecurityTestConfig` to disable CSRF and allow passthrough behavior.

* Updated `AuthProxyService.java` (explicit JSON content type)
* Added `SecurityTestConfig.java` for test slice security
* Added `AuthControllerTest.java`, covering success and error paths

---

### **Verification**

Changes were validated by:

* Running `mvn clean test` to ensure all tests passed successfully
* Confirming Spring Security configuration allowed test access to `/auth/*`
