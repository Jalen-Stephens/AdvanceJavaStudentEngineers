### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

The AI assistant was used to help set up the initial iteration of the MetaDetect AI Image Detection Service project by providing technical guidance on:

* Refactoring and renaming the base Spring Boot application from **IndividualProject** → **MetaDetect**
* Updating Java package paths to `dev.coms4156.project.metadetect`
* Revising the `pom.xml` to reflect new coordinates (`groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, `name`) and to add Checkstyle, PMD, and JaCoCo (≥ 55 % coverage)
* Adjusting `application.properties` to use `spring.application.name=metadetect-service` and `spring.application.version=0.1.0`
* Cleaning Git tracking (`.gitignore` fixes and `.idea` untracking)
* Crafting consistent commit messages and PR templates mapped to the Kanban workflow

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

Prompts and questions provided to ChatGPT included:

* “What should my Kanban ticket be called for setting up the skeleton code?”
* “How should I rename my Spring Boot app and packages to MetaDetect?”

- **Access Method:** ChatGPT Web (.edu academic access)  
- **Configuration:** Default model settings  
- **Cost:** $0 (no paid API calls)  

---

### **Purpose of AI Assistance**
Assistance was used to **debug and configure Maven build behavior** for the `AnalyzeService` Spring Boot service.  
The AI helped ensure that the **C2PAtool binary** (used for AI-image authenticity verification) is correctly downloaded, unpacked, and persisted across build phases so it remains executable both locally and in deployment.  

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**
- Asked why `mvn package` wasn’t producing the `tools/c2patool` binary.  
- Requested possible solutions to `pom.xml` configuration using `download-maven-plugin` and `maven-antrun-plugin`.  
- Troubleshot successive build errors (e.g. "file is directory", missing binary). 
- Asked how to keep the binary after packaging and why Maven was deleting it.  
- Requested an explanation of the final working solution and how to preserve the executable between builds.  

---

### **Resulting Artifacts**
- **Edited File:** `pom.xml`  
  - Added `download-maven-plugin` section to fetch `c2patool-v0.9.12-universal-apple-darwin.zip`.  
  - Added `maven-antrun-plugin` section to unzip, copy, chmod, and retain the binary.  
- **New Directory:** `tools/` (containing executable `c2patool`)  
- **Build Artifact:** Verified Maven package with `tools/c2patool` present and executable.  

---

### **Verification**
- Ran `mvn clean package` to confirm the binary appears at `./tools/c2patool`.  
- Executed `./tools/c2patool --version` to verify the file runs successfully.  
- Rebuilt the Spring Boot JAR to ensure the `tools/` directory remains intact after packaging.  
- Manually inspected Maven logs and filesystem to confirm that no cleanup phase deletes the binary.
